Correct assumptions about interpreting multi-axis goniometer axes from full-CBF files. Previously, it was assumed the ``axis`` and ``diffrn_scan_axis`` categories listed axes in the same order, and that this matched a standard diffractometer axis order. The goniometer model is now build correctly, regardless of the order specified in the file.
